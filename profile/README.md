# Welcome to the mod-posh collection

## Overview

In this organization, you will find repositories filled with C# or PowerShell code based in no small part on the code that can be found in the original [repo](https://github.com/jeffpatton1971/mod-posh). A lot of the code found there will ultimately wind up here, hopefully all grown up! In addition to that, you will also find my [LocalAutomation](https://github.com/mod-posh/LocalAutomaion) repo that contains skeletons for how many of my projects get set up. I'm also converting all that automation into discreet Github Actions that can be put together in your pipelines.

## Contributing
